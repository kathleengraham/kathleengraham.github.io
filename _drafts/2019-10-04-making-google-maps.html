    After traveling more and more this past decade and living in Asia for three years, I wanted a way to keep track of all the places I'd been, especially since my travel bucket list just keeps growing. So I began to go into the maps section of my Google account and add a star for each place. It's cool to look at the entire globe and see all the stars around it. As I was working on my travel gallery, I realized there were some places I had missed when adding stars to my Google map. When I went in to add some of those stars, I discovered a section for creating maps with other kinds of data, not just a star on the location or lists of places you want to go in the future. Just five minutes later, I had plotted all the data from a .csv file I have with endangered languages around the world. This is what I discovered!
