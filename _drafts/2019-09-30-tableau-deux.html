    Each week when we get to Class 2, I feel like it ends up being the 'technical challenge' experience from the <a href='https://thegreatbritishbakeoff.co.uk/news-and-recipes/'><em>Great British Bake-Off</em></a>. Class 2 of Tableau Week was no different! 
    <br><br>
    We began with some more complicated interactive elements of Tableau and using LOD (level of detail). Later, we moved toward mapping out visualizations with geographic coordinates.

    First, we warmed up by analyzing a data set on higher educational institutions from the 2013-2014 academic year. We tried to answer the following:
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>Is there a relationship between an institution's average ACT/SAT scores and the average number of doctorates awarded?</li>
        <li>Which regions in the United States have the greatest percentage of students receiving federal grant aid?</li>
        <li>Is there a correlation between SAT scores and regions?</li>
        <li>Of the institutions with religious affiliations, schools belonging to which denominations receive the most foreign undergraduate students?</li>
        <li>Do foreign undergraduates prefer institutions that award only bachelor's degrees, or master's, or doctorates?</li>
        <li>Of institutions that offer bachelor's, master's, or doctorates as the highest degrees, which have the highest graduation rates within four years?</li>
        <li>Is there a correlation between tuition and SAT scores? </li>
    </ul> 
    <br>
    Then, we observed how to make different sets depending on what you would like to show with the data.
