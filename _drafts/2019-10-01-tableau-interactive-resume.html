<p>
    Several weeks back, a friend of mine tagged me in a comment on a LinkedIn post from Tableau Software about making an interactive resume. I finally looked into it now that we have reached Tableau Week in the boot camp. Wow! Tableau Public has a whole gallery of interactive resumes that people have built and shared. They even have a tutorial on how to make one and encourage people to download other people's notebooks and dashboards to explore how they made something cool.

    I decided I want to give it a go!
