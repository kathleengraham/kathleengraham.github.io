    Hiya! I'm Kathleen, a teacher turned programmer living in Chicago. I taught English as a Second Language in Asia for three years and online for more than two years which allowed me to have adventures across a dozen countries. Eventually, my love for natural languages led me to formal languages, and I am now on my way to becoming a polyglot in both!
    <br><br>
    Currently, I'm finishing up the Data Science Boot Camp at Northwestern University, and I volunteer with <a href='https://www.tealsk12.org'>Microsoft Philanthropies TEALS</a> as the Lead Intro to CS Instructor with Python for an Adult Basic class at Pima Community College. Forever a teacher, forever a student.
