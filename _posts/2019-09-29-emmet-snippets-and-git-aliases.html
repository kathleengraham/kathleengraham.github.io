<h3 style="text-align: center;"><em>Customized Emmet Snippets and Git Aliases</em></h3><br>

<h5>Emmet in VS Code</h5>
<br>
<p>
    Visual Studio Code is my favorite editor. I've gotten used to it, and the customizations are awesome. I learned about Emmet in VS Code a few weeks back from the organizer of our local Chicago freeCodeCamp study group, Robert Groves. He showed me how I can type certain patterns of tags that I want, press tab, and it all appears in the order I specified with proper indentation and even certain attributes already set, such as the <code><a></code> tag automatically 
</p>
<br>
<p>
    I also figured out how to use the <code>lorem100</code> <a href='https://docs.emmet.io/abbreviations/lorem-ipsum/'>emmet generator</a> to make the following paragraph of Lorem ipsum text with 100 words.
</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
    Lorem ipsum dolor, sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Molestiae facilis quaerat libero et. Voluptatem, similique blanditiis sequi fugit obcaecati quaerat, iste culpa repudiandae soluta fuga odio nostrum, eius in dignissimos? Dolor, aliquam, alias odio officia, perspiciatis maiores ea cumque quaerat architecto dolores aperiam nisi esse vitae non quasi? Veritatis dolor rerum temporibus est eveniet beatae hic, inventore voluptate nulla libero dolorem quasi dolores aut enim delectus distinctio numquam impedit architecto magni voluptatem vel? Tempore vitae consequuntur, rerum similique id quaerat est nulla corrupti ipsam voluptatibus, culpa, minus sint molestias? Nesciunt ipsa quas ab temporibus incidunt dolorem debitis ipsum, quam culpa!
</blockquote>

<h5>Cheatsheet</h5>
<br>
<p>
    Honestly, though, Emmet is neverending. As <a href='https://docs.emmet.io/cheatsheet-a5.pdf' target_='blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>this cheatsheet</a> clearly shows. Oi! I even got distracted by editing my own anchor tags in Emmet to be the style that I like. I read a <a href='https://scotch.io/bar-talk/write-less-code-by-creating-snippets-in-visual-studio-code' target_='blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>helpful article</a> about it, and got started on customizing my own snippet for the anchor tag.

<h5>Git Aliases</h5>
<br>
<p>
    Here is a <a href='https://codeburst.io/learn-how-to-create-custom-bash-commands-in-less-than-4-minutes-6d4ceadd9590'>tutorial</a> on how to set aliases for GitBash commands.
    
    However, I found <a href='http://kurtdowswell.com/software-development/git-bash-aliases/' target_='blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>this post</a> by Kurt Dowswell to be much more effective since it keeps the changes forever and I don't have to keep typing 'source ~/.custom_aliases' every time I open bash. I also like how extensive his list is and that I could add one for 'git push origin master' wherever I liked. I also liked how easy he made it to list out all the aliases in Git Bash if I ever forgot the ones that were set. So I have officially followed his step by step and am very pleased with my new git aliases! My personal favorite is 'g ac' so I can type my commit message after that without having any errors like with the .custom_aliases function with a placeholder. Yay for progress in improving my environment for better productivity!
