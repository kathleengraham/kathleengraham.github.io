    Each week when we get to Class 2, I feel like it ends up being the 'technical challenge' experience from the <a href='https://thegreatbritishbakeoff.co.uk/news-and-recipes/'><em>Great British Bake-Off</em></a>. Class 2 of Tableau Week was no different! 
    <br><br>
    We began with some more complicated interactive elements of Tableau and using LOD (level of detail). Later, we moved toward mapping out visualizations with geographic coordinates.

<h4><u>Part 1</u></h4>
<p>
    We warmed up by analyzing a data set on higher educational institutions from the 2013-2014 academic year</a>. We initially were exploring the following:
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>Is there a relationship between an institution's average ACT/SAT scores and the average number of doctorates awarded?</li>
        <li>Which regions in the United States have the greatest percentage of students receiving federal grant aid?</li>
        <li>Is there a correlation between SAT scores and regions?</li>
        <li>Of the institutions with religious affiliations, schools belonging to which denominations receive the most foreign undergraduate students?</li>
        <li>Do foreign undergraduates prefer institutions that award only bachelor's degrees, or master's, or doctorates?</li>
        <li>Of institutions that offer bachelor's, master's, or doctorates as the highest degrees, which have the highest graduation rates within four years?</li>
        <li>Is there a correlation between tuition and SAT scores? </li>
    </ul> 
    <br>
    But we all came up with quite unique visualizations in Tableau. My first try is <a href='https://public.tableau.com/profile/kathleengraham#!/vizhome/GraduationRatesatCollegesandUniversitiesintheUnitedStates_15722154899400/USGradRatesvsTuitionvsAdmittance'>here</a>.

<h4><u>Part 2</u></h4>
<p> Then, we observed how to make different sets depending on what you would like to show with the data. After a few more examples and explorations of data, we moved to geographic coordinates. When I go back to review, I will add more details here and show off a few more of the visualizations I was able to make.</p>
