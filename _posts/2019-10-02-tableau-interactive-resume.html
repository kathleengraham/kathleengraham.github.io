    Several weeks back, a friend of mine tagged me in a comment on a LinkedIn post from Tableau Software about making an interactive resume. I finally looked into it now that we have reached Tableau Week in the boot camp. Wow! Tableau Public has a whole gallery of interactive resumes that people have built and shared. They even have a tutorial on how to make one and encourage people to download other people's notebooks and dashboards to explore how they made something cool. I decided I want to give it a go!

<p>I have made the interactive bar chart so far showcasing my experience over time, switching between professional roles, volunteer positions, and educational experiences. But it's still a work in progress. I don't want to add it to Tableau Public until I have it all set, though. That's the one downside of Tableau Public I have found. I want to save my work, but I don't want to save my work in progress <em>publicly</em>. But I will definitely publish it at a point when I feel that it is complete enough to be shared. I'm so close!</p>
