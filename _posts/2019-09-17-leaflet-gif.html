    <h3 style="text-align: center;"><em>Legends in Leaflet.js and ScreenToGif</em></h3><br>

    <p>Today had a lot of learning in it. I made an interactive visualization of earthquake data from the past 30 days using Leaflet.js and Mapbox. I was really excited to work out the color scale from light to dark and put it on the legend. Getting the info on the legend to work properly at all was definitely the most difficult part for me. It all had to do with how to concatentate the strings properly based on certain indices while looping through an array. Beating that challenge was exciting!</p>

    <p>But more exciting than that was finding out there is a program called <a href="https://www.screentogif.com/">ScreenToGif</a> that allows you to take a short video of your screen and save it in gif format. I didn't know that! I'm super excited because it is a very simple thing that makes it even more possible to share some of my creations. Everybody loves gifs, and I can share them through readmes, tweets, email, or even right here in this post...</p>

    <p>... which I finally figured out how to do using Jekyll's documentation on blog posts. Hooray!</p><br>
