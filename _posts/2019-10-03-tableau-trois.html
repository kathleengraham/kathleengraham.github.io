    We had a competition of sorts in class 3 of Tableau Week. We all had the same data sets but we were challenged with making dashboards that show insights found for three different prompts. It was fun to see how different everybody's dashboards could be!

    We started off analyzing flight data. Since I have traveled to over a dozen countries, I was particularly interested in observing and making sense of this data. However, I haven't saved a lot of those analyzations in Tableau Public because they weren't exactly the most visually appealing at first. I realize I can go back and improve them and just override the file with a better one, but it's a little frustrating to have unpolished analyzations on my Tableau Public profile. Especially since it's a place where I have seen a lot of impressive material. I will have to come back and publish these while adding more notes here in upcoming weeks.
