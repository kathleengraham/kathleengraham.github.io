    Here is a <a href='https://codeburst.io/learn-how-to-create-custom-bash-commands-in-less-than-4-minutes-6d4ceadd9590' target_='blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>tutorial</a> on how to set aliases for GitBash commands.

    However, I found <a href='http://kurtdowswell.com/software-development/git-bash-aliases/' target_='blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>this post</a> by Kurt Dowswell to be much more effective since it keeps the changes forever and I don't have to keep typing 'source ~/.custom_aliases' every time I open bash. I also like how extensive his list is and that I could add one for 'git push origin master' wherever I liked. I also liked how easy he made it to list out all the aliases in Git Bash if I ever forgot the ones that were set. So I have officially followed his step by step and am very pleased with my new git aliases! My personal favorite is 'g ac' so I can type my commit message after that without having any errors like with the .custom_aliases function with a placeholder. Yay for progress in improving my environment for better productivity!
