    I am a little behind in my posts. But October has been a crazy month! Microsoft TEALSK12 sent me to Tucson to meet my awesome students, my birthday was last week, I've been working towards a final project in Natural Language Processing, and I will graduate from my Data Analytics and Visualization Boot Camp in two days! Wow! Graduating doesn't mean that I will stop there, though. I'm just getting started! I'm really looking forward to having a bit more free time to dedicate to posting on here about what all I'm learning each day.
