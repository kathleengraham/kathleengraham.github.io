    We had a competition of sorts in class 3 of Tableau Week. We all had the same data sets but we were challenged with making dashboards that show insights found for three different prompts. It was fun to see how different everybody's dashboards could be!

    We started off analyzing flight data. Since I have traveled to over a dozen countries, I was particularly interested in observing and making sense of this data. However, I haven't saved a lot of those analyzations in Tableau Public because they weren't exactly the most visually appealing at first. I realize I can go back and improve them and just override the file with a better one, but it's a little frustrating to have unpolished analyzations on my Tableau Public profile. Especially since it's a place where I have seen a lot of impressive material. I will have to come back and publish these while adding more notes here in upcoming weeks.

    Note: <br>
    I am a little behind in my posts. I have over a dozen drafts to get to from the past two weeks. Even though my drafts are empty, I've been keeping up with how much I learn each day and the topics I've gone through in a notebook. It takes time to type it all up and create the images and gifs, but I'm determined to go back and add more and more detail so that I can look back on this entire portfolio in a few weeks with amazement. It really is incredible how much I learn in a given day, and it will be extremely beneficial to be able to come back and review with as much detail as possible.
