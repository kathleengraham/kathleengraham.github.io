    <h5>My Own Advice</h5>
    <p>
        I sat by the window for hours this morning, teaching and listening to the rain. Our TEALS teaching team was trying to encourage the students that were
        feeling overwhelmed or discouraged by the amount of material that we've covered that they haven't completed or still don't understand. We began
        discussing the benefits of writing things down or even journaling. We also talked about sharing with others and teaching others, even if you don't know
        it all that well yourself yet.
    </p><br>
    <h5>Keep Track</h5><br>
    <p>
        Is it coincidence that I got an email from dev.to with popular links to articles and one of them was about a code journal? I think not! I realized I 
        really need to start taking my own advice and keep tracking of my learning. Who cares if people see it? I am learning so much and then turning around
        and teaching so much, I need a place where I can keep track of it all.

    <h5>Improving READMEs</h5><br>
    <p>
        So I'll start with something simple. I was improving my README files for past projects, and I discovered that when using markdown, it's really easy to
        mix in HTML and specialize it even more. I'm happy about that because I had some strange instances when I wanted to write superscript of more than just
        numbers that were squared or cubed. I also wanted to center images. I was able to do so with simple HTML tags, and it makes the README's look a lot more
        clean. I also added some break tags to separate sections so everything is less condensed.

    <h5>Making Better Gifs</h5><br>
    <p>
        Something else I was excited about recently was learning how to make gifs. Now... I'm still horrible at making them, but I'm discovering more features
        the more that I try to do. Through trial and error, I figured out how to delete lots of frames, blur or erase things on the screen in all frames,
        speed up or slow down the gif, and make different sizes. Then saving this in an image tag in the README allows me to adjust the width so there aren't
        these giant gifs repeating on the page making people dizzy.
