<h3 style="text-align: center;"><em>Tableau</em></h3><br>

<h5>Getting Started</h5>
<br>
    <p>
        It's a dreary Saturday in Chicago, and we're getting closer and closer to the end of the boot camp. We have reached the week that a lot of people have been waiting for since the first day of class: Tableau Week!
        <br>
        Initially, I didn't know how to feel about Tableau because I had enjoyed figuring out all the tricky code with plotting in Matplotlib, D3.js, Plotly.js, Leaflet.js, and others. But now I get why everyone loves Tableau. I've already had so much fun playing around with different features!

<h5>Learning from Doing</h5>
    <p>    
        I downloaded <a href='https://public.tableau.com' target_='blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Tableau Public</a> and made an account so that I could save my files. After just a few activities, I was getting used to a lot of the features, <em>and</em> I had a whole profile full of cool visualizations.

<h5>Candy Visualization (Chocolate vs. Fruity)</h5>
<br>
    <p>
        My favorite activity was analyzing candy. It seemed silly at first, but it showed how fast this particularly software can be for visualizing special cases quickly. Here are the steps I experimented with:

        <h6>Step 1: Data</h6>
