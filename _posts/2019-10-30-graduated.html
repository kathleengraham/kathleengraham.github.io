<p>
    My Data Science Boot Camp at Northwestern University is officially complete! I graduated with an A and have over 20 projects in my GitHub portfolio.<br><br>
    I'm so thankful to everyone that supported me during the past six months of this boot camp. It was a crazy ride, but it was the best decision I ever made.
