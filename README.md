# Kathleen Graham's Personal Website

This repository has all the files needed to build [my personal website](https://kathleengraham.github.io).

## Steps


Instead of building my website from scratch like I've done with other projects, I wanted to learn how to build a portfolio using GitHub Pages' Jekyll themes. First, I tried some themes that Github Pages supports, but these were confusing to set up from scratch using the Jekyll tutorial. So I tried to follow some tutorials on YouTube for these themes, but it was also taking too long to get it all working. Since I wanted a portfolio fast that I could quickly go in and add a post in minutes, I knew figuring out Jekyll would be worth it, so I tried doing a little more research about it at this point to better my understanding.

Then one day, I started following a woman developer on Twitter that had some really cool talks online. I discovered her awesome website and noticed that it was designed by HTML5 UP and the Jekyll integration was by Chris Bobbe. I knew enough about Jekyll integration at this point that I could easily tell that Chris Bobbe's Jekyll integration repository README had the exact explanations I would need to be able to quickly set up a 'Code Journal' in blog format as well as a portfolio, a reading list, and a small image gallery. I knew it'd be easier to specialize it, really make it my own, and also add additional pages in the future. A huge thank you to Chris Bobbe's thorough README (which you can find in previous commits of this repository).
